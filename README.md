# NoFlashingLights
Mod that stops lights from flashing in Starbound. Sets flickering lights to 50% brightness instead, and sets flashing alarms to be constantly red.

Currently patches:
flickeringfluorescentlight

prisonfloodlightBroken
displaylightbroken
underwaterlightsmallBroken
redlightBroken
protectoratebrokenlight
apexshiplightBroken

and replaces alarm.lua to fix:
alertlight

alarm

(I'd have patched those ones too but it doesn't look like there's a way to do that)
