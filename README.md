# NoFlashingLights
Mod that stops lights from flashing in Starbound.

Currently patches:

lightbulb
prisonfloodlightBroken
displaylightbroken
underwaterlightsmallBroken
redlightBroken
protectoratebrokenlight
apexshiplightBroken
floodlightsmallflickering

and replaces alarm.lua to fix:
alertlight

alarm

(I'd have patched those ones too but it doesn't look like there's a way to do that)
